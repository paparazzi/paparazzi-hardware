Older revisions:
----------------
This is a cleaned up repository that does not contain all the history of the
files. For older revisions please check the SVN repository on Savannah:

Techno:
-------
PCBs are 4 layers boards.
  They can be ordered from companies like eurocircuits (www.eurocircuits.com).
  I solder the components with a fine temperatue controlled iron. The IMU board 
  contains BGA gyros which will require some sort hot hot air method.

Tools:
  This files are produced using Eagle (www.cadsoft.de) version 4.11 for Linux.
  gerbmerge (http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/Python/gerbmerge/) is a
  free gerber panelisation tool. gerbv (http://gerbv.sourceforge.net) is a free
  gerber viewer. eagle3d ( http://www.matwei.de/doku.php?id=en:eagle3d:eagle3d )
  is a tool that allows generation of povray views of the boards.

Outputs:
  We use the eagle batch CAM processor to generate various outputs.
  type "make gerber" to generate gerber.
  type "make printable" to generate postscript and pdf. 
  they will be put in a printable subdirectory in each subdirectory. 

Directory content:
------------------
panel: 
  Contains configuration files used in conjunction with gerbmerge to produce a pannel
  to be sent to the PCB manufacturer (eurocircuits). A panel is a big PCB containing several smaller PCB.
  It allows you to choose which boards you want for your particular system.

controller: 
  This are the paparazzi controller boards.

sensors:

tools:


lib: 
  contains eagle library parts for components not found in the standard eagle library.
